# Federel Manifesto

## 🌐 What We're Building

Federel is a federated protocol for **Internet search** — not just search in general.

We’re creating a system where:

- AI agents summarize and learn from content that users actually browse or publish
- Knowledge is shared responsibly, only by verified domain owners
- There is no ranking system — only relevance based on meaning and intent

This is a **new model of Internet search** — one that respects privacy, resists manipulation, and re-centers the user and the creator.

## 🤔 Why We're Doing This

The Internet is the most powerful publishing medium in human history — and search is its primary gateway.

But today:
- A handful of corporations decide what content is visible
- SEO and advertising distort the information landscape
- AI is trained on content without permission or credit
- Trust in information is eroding

Federel is an attempt to fix this by changing how we search — and more importantly, **how we share and trust knowledge**.

## 🎯 Our Vision

We believe the future of Internet search should be:

- **Free and expressive**, but also **accountable**
- **Decentralized**, yet **cooperative**
- Enhanced by **AI**, but anchored in **human values**

With Federel, we combine:

- 🧠 **AI** for summarization, reasoning, and relevance
- 🔐 **DNS** as a source of publishing responsibility
- 🗳️ **Collective user intent** as a measure of what matters

So we can build a system where:
- Creators control what they publish
- Users control what they see
- Spam and manipulation lose their power

## 📢 Our Belief

The Internet is not just content — it’s communication.  
And **search is how we listen**.

To preserve freedom of speech, we must also enable **responsible discovery** — where users decide what is valuable, not algorithms optimized for profit.

Federel is a step toward a future where:
- Search is transparent
- Publishing is accountable
- Knowledge is shared, not scraped
