## 🔐 Federel Trust Protocol

Federel relies on a decentralized, DNS-based identity system to ensure that only **verified domain owners** can contribute distilled knowledge to the global knowledge pool. This mechanism helps:

- Prevent content scraping and copyright violations
- Make AI knowledge contributions traceable and accountable
- Enable open participation while minimizing spam and abuse

We call this the **Federel Trust Protocol**, and it is built around the concept of the **Knowledge Publisher ID (KPID)**.

## 🔑 What Is a KPID?

A **Knowledge Publisher ID (KPID)** is a cryptographically verifiable identity linked to a specific domain.

In Federel, "knowledge" refers specifically to **distilled content** generated by AI summarization. This ensures that what is shared is not raw data or scraped pages, but structured, meaningful representations of intent-relevant content.

- It proves that an agent submitting knowledge from a website **owns or controls** that domain.
- It is published in the domain’s DNS (via a TXT record)
- It allows agents to **sign and validate** knowledge submissions

> Only content that originates from a verified KPID is eligible for inclusion in the global shared pool.

---

## 🔄 Trust Workflow

### 1. KPID Generation
- A domain owner generates a KPID (e.g., via CLI or web UI)
- It may be a keypair, signed token, or registrar-issued ID

### 2. DNS Verification
- The domain owner adds a TXT record to their DNS zone:
  
  ```txt
  _federel.example.com TXT "KPID=abc123..."
  ```

- The agent or publishing tool verifies this record before allowing submission of knowledge

### 3. Knowledge Submission
- Distilled knowledge chunks from that domain are signed with the KPID
- Other agents verify that the knowledge:
  - Comes from a verified domain
  - Has not been tampered with

---

## 🧹 Revocation & Rotation

If a KPID is compromised or needs to be replaced:

- Remove or update the TXT record
- Optionally notify trusted registrars or Federel hubs
- Other agents will mark old knowledge as stale or unverified

This model ensures that **trust is both verifiable and revocable**.

---

## 🔐 Why DNS?

- DNS is already a **global system of domain authority**
- Adding a TXT record is easy, fast, and well-supported
- It's used by protocols like SPF, DKIM, and Mastodon (WebFinger)
- Federel simply extends this mechanism to knowledge publishing

---

## 📄 Sample DNS TXT Record

```txt
_federel.yoursite.com TXT "KPID=bd91c73a-signed-key"
```

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Formal specification of the KPID token format (JWT, Ed25519, etc.)
- Registrar plugins for seamless integration
- Federation metadata in the TXT record (e.g., topics, license)
- Signed manifest files alongside robots.txt

---

## 🛡️ Summary

Federel’s federated trust model gives the Internet a lightweight, robust way to:

- Respect content ownership
- Fight misinformation and spam
- Encourage transparency in AI-powered Internet search

By anchoring identity in DNS, we avoid central authority while building a system of **responsible knowledge sharing**.
