# Federel: A Federated, Responsible AI Search Protocol

## Overview

**Federel** is an open, federated protocol and proof-of-concept for a new type of AI-powered Internet search and knowledge system. Instead of relying on centralized crawlers, ad-based ranking algorithms, or opaque data harvesting, Federel is built around:

- **Decentralized agents** that crawl and learn from web content browsed or published by real users.
- **Federated sharing** of distilled knowledge — not raw data — between autonomous AI agents.
- **Verifiable accountability**, where only domain owners can contribute distilled knowledge from their sites to the shared knowledge pool.
- **Privacy-first design**, where personal browsing contributes to private knowledge only, unless explicitly shared.

## Motivation

Search is broken. Traditional search engines:
- Are vulnerable to SEO spam
- Prioritize profit and ad-driven results
- Index the web indiscriminately
- Are black-box systems controlled by a handful of corporations

Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a powerful tool for summarization, reasoning, and intent-matching — but it too suffers from hallucination, lack of provenance, and legal challenges when trained on unlicensed content.

Federel proposes a new way:
- Knowledge is gathered through **real user intent** and **agent-based discovery**.
- Content is summarized and embedded **locally**.
- Sharing is optional, traceable, and **accountable to the originator**.

## Key Principles

### 1. Local Agents
Each user (or organization) runs a **local AI agent** that:
- Crawls pages visited or owned by the user
- Summarizes and embeds content
- Builds a private semantic knowledge base
- Optionally shares distilled knowledge into the global pool

These agents can run:
- On **self-hosted open-source servers** (for privacy and full control)
- Or as **cloud-managed APIs** powered by commercial AI services (for accessibility and scalability)

This hybrid approach allows users to choose the balance of control, privacy, and convenience that best suits their needs.

### 2. Verified Domain Contribution
To contribute public knowledge:
- The domain owner must verify control via **DNS TXT record**
- A **Knowledge Publisher ID (KPID)** is issued, linked to the domain
- The AI agent uses this KPID to sign all contributed knowledge chunks
- Other agents verify the source before accepting it into the pool

Only verified domains can contribute public knowledge, solving legal/copyright issues and enabling traceable authorship.

### 3. No Ranking, Only Relevance
There is no ranking system in Federel.
- The LLM-powered agents surface knowledge based on **semantic relevance** to user queries.
- There is nothing to “game” — junk content is ignored because it’s not relevant, not because it’s ranked low.

### 4. Reputation & Responsibility
- Every contribution is linked to its **KPID**.
- Malicious or low-quality content affects the **reputation of that KPID**.
- Publishers take full legal and ethical responsibility for what they share.

### 5. Community Feedback
- Users can provide feedback to their agents (e.g., “avoid this site”, “this is spam”) to personalize results.
- When similar feedback is aggregated across agents, the system can learn to soft-filter low-quality sources.

## Technical Building Blocks

- **Crawler**: Lightweight local agent with URL filtering
- **Summarizer**: LLM-powered (OpenAI, LLaMA, etc.) content-to-embedding pipeline
- **Embedding DB**: Local store (FAISS, ChromaDB, etc.) for semantic search
- **Query Agent**: LLM-powered conversational interface over retrieved knowledge
- **Publisher Protocol**:
  - KPID generation via registrar
  - DNS-based verification
  - Signed knowledge packages

## Identity and Revocation
- KPIDs are issued per domain via registrars
- To revoke a compromised KPID:
  - Remove DNS record
  - Registrar blacklists the KPID
  - Agents soft-delete or ignore future data from that ID

## Seeding and Scaling
- A small set of early adopters and content owners can **seed the network** with trusted, high-quality knowledge
- Agents grow smarter with use and feedback
- As users begin benefiting from accurate, conversational search — adoption grows organically

## Use Cases
- **Content creators** publish distilled knowledge about their topics
- **Companies** expose structured, searchable versions of their knowledge bases
- **Individuals** query their own AI assistant for information across trusted public sources
- **Communities** self-curate topic-specific knowledge bases

## Status
This is a concept and prototype phase project. The goal is to:
1. Open the idea to public scrutiny and input
2. Build a minimal demo pipeline (crawl → summarize → store → query)
3. Publish the core specs for:
   - KPID + DNS verification
   - Knowledge contribution format
   - Agent-to-agent communication
