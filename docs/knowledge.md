## 🧠 Federel Knowledge Format

This document defines the format and structure of a **distilled knowledge chunk** in the Federel protocol.

Federel knowledge is not raw HTML or scraped content. It is:
- AI-generated summarization of specific web content
- Tagged with semantic and structural metadata
- Cryptographically signed by a verified domain owner (via KPID)
- Stored locally by agents and optionally shared via federation

---

## 🔖 Purpose of Knowledge Chunks

Each chunk:
- Encapsulates a distilled representation of one page, article, or post
- Enables **semantic retrieval** via vector similarity search
- Preserves traceability to the **source domain + identity**
- Can be evaluated for freshness, trust, or relevancy

## 🧱 Knowledge Chunk Schema (v0.1)

```json
{
  "summary": "string",                 // AI-generated summary (single paragraph)
  "embedding": [float],                // Optional: vector representation
  "source_url": "https://...",         // Original URL
  "domain": "example.com",            // Verified domain name
  "kpid": "abc123signature...",       // Domain's Knowledge Publisher ID
  "timestamp": "2025-03-21T14:55:00Z", // When it was generated
  "topics": ["ai", "federation"],      // Optional: content tags or keywords
  "license": "CC-BY-SA-4.0",           // Optional: declared license
  "signature": "signed-hash-or-proof"  // Optional: cryptographic proof
}
```

### 📝 Notes
- `summary` can be short (for preview) or long (full overview)
- `embedding` is generated by the same agent during summarization
- `kpid` links the chunk to a verified domain owner
- `signature` ensures authenticity of the chunk (optional in MVP)

---

## 📦 Packaging & Storage

Knowledge chunks are:
- Stored locally in a vector store (e.g. FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate)
- Indexed with semantic and keyword metadata
- Exportable in bulk for syncing or federated sharing

---

## 🔐 Verification

Before a chunk is accepted into a public pool, it must:
1. Be signed with a valid KPID
2. Match a published DNS TXT record
3. Optionally include content hash for integrity checks

---

## 🌐 Future Enhancements

- Support for multilingual summaries
- Chained summaries (e.g. page → site → topic)
- Relevance scoring from agent usage
- Inference-time expansion using context windows

---

## 📚 Summary

The knowledge chunk is the atomic unit of intent-driven, verified, and semantically retrievable AI knowledge in Federel.

This format enables:
- Personal search across trusted sources
- Federated aggregation of verified knowledge
- Open, ethical, and future-proof Internet search.
